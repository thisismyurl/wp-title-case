# This Is My URL - WP Title Case

[![CI](https://github.com/thisismyurl/wp-title-case/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thisismyurl/wp-title-case/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![WordPress](https://img.shields.io/badge/WordPress-5.0%2B-blue)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-title-case/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL--2.0-blue)](LICENSE)

Auto-applies title-case rules to WordPress page and post titles via the `the_title` filter — display only, no database writes. Built for content teams that want consistent headline formatting without editing every title by hand.

## The short story

I wrote this plugin in 2008. In January 2016, Phill Coxon took it over and shepherded it through the WordPress 4.x era. The plugin went quiet for a while, but I've brought it back home to keep it working on modern WordPress.

Same plugin, same `the_title` filter approach, same minimum-letter-count exclusion, same harmless display-only behaviour. It just lives at [github.com/thisismyurl/wp-title-case](https://github.com/thisismyurl/wp-title-case) again, and the maintenance is mine.

## What it does

- **Capitalises words** in post and page titles according to title-case conventions.
- **Excludes short words** (default: 2 letters or fewer) so "of", "to", "in", and "the" stay lowercase.
- **Display-only** — uses the `the_title` filter, never modifies `wp_posts.post_title`.
- **Works everywhere** — browser titles, post and page titles, category and tag lists, and feeds.

## What it doesn't do

- It doesn't enforce a particular style guide (AP, Chicago, MLA). It applies one simple rule: capitalise words above N letters.
- It doesn't make database-level content edits. Every transform happens at render time through WordPress title filters.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.4+

## Installation

**WordPress.org plugin directory (recommended):**

- Install from WordPress admin: **Plugins > Add New** → search "WP Title Case" → **Install Now**.
- Or visit [WP Title Case on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-title-case/).

**Manual installation:**

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Unzip to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-title-case/`.
3. Activate through **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.

Once activated, the plugin works immediately with its default settings. No configuration needed.

## Standards

- Direct-access protection with `ABSPATH` checks.
- Nonce and capability checks for all admin actions.
- Aligned with WordPress coding standards.
- Legacy common-class scaffolding has been removed; plugin lifecycle hooks now live in the main plugin class.

## Changelog

See [releases](../../releases) or [readme.txt](readme.txt).

## Support and donations

I build these tools because WordPress sites in the wild keep hitting the same problems, and a small, focused plugin is usually the right fix. They're free to use, with no tracking and no ads.

If one of them saves you time, here are the genuine ways to help:

- **Sponsor the work.** [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/thisismyurl) is the simplest way, and the Sponsor button at the top of this repo lists it alongside Bitcoin, Dogecoin, PayPal, and Interac e-transfer. Any amount helps, and none of it is expected.
- **Contribute code or ideas.** A pull request, a bug report, or a tested edge case is worth as much as a donation. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
- **Share it.** A note on [WordPress.org](https://profiles.wordpress.org/thisismyurl/), [GitHub](https://github.com/thisismyurl), or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/thisismyurl) helps other people find work that might save them the same afternoon.

### Report issues and questions

- **Found a bug or want a feature?** Open an issue on the [Issues](../../issues) tab. Include your WordPress and PHP versions and the steps to reproduce it.
- **Have a question?** Start a thread on the [Discussions](../../discussions) tab.

### Contributing code

Code contributions are welcome. The short version:

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch with a clear name, like `feature/add-style-guide-option`.
3. Make your change and test it against the edge cases.
4. Run the coding-standards check before you open the pull request.
5. Open a pull request that explains what changed and why.

The full workflow and standards live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Contributing is never required, but it is always appreciated.
